  		<h2>Mealplan</h2>
  		<p>The easiest way to get involved in pika is to join our <a href="mealplan.html">mealplan</a>. Email pika-mealplan at mit.edu to sign up!</p>

  		<hr class="featurette-divider">

  		<h2>Continuous Rush</h2>
  		<p>pika practices "continuous rush", meaning that we are always welcoming new pikans. Our process is pretty unique.</p>

  		<h4>The Rush Process</h4>
		<ul>
		<li> <b>Come over</b> a couple of times! Meet some of the cool people who live here! Dinner and <a href="#rush">rush</a> are some of the best times to enjoy some free food, meet us, and learn how pika functions. We cook every night during term! The exact time changes every once in a while according to pikans' schedules, but it's a safe bet come over at 6:30pm--it'll be either served or almost done.
		</li>
		<li> Get a <b>house tour</b>! Hear some of the crazy stories, and see the unbelievable for yourself (yes, that is a three story firepole!) Ask anyone for a tour. All of us have some great stories to share. (Take a sneak peak at the house on our <!--TODO--><a href="tour.html">Virtual House Tour</a>, too.)
		</li>
		<li> Let one of us know that you might be interested in living here. Even if you're not sure, don't be afraid. Just say it. Hopefully, they'll ask you at the end of your housetour and make it easy for you. 
		</li>
		<li> Once you've let us know that you're interested, we have a vote; if everything works out, we'll give you a <b>bid</b>. (Yay!) This, first and foremost, means pikans think you are <b>AWESOME</b>! This also means that you can move into pika any time in the next two years so long as you are still an MIT student (grad, undergrad, whatever).  Or you can just keep hanging out with us - there's no pressure to choose instantly.   
		</li>
		<li> You <b>move in</b> as soon as you like - if there's room in the house, you can move in even in the middle of a term! (Unfortunately, due to MIT regulations freshmen cannot live in the house, but they can still let us know that they will move in next year!)</li>
		</ul>
  		<h4>Exchange Students and Other Travellers</h4>
  		<p>If you're coming to MIT as an exchange student or otherwise can't be around to hang out at pika, but want to move in, we can set you up with a rush survey and give you an informal video call to get to know you. To start that process, email pika-rush at mit.edu.</p>

  		<hr class="featurette-divider">

  		<h2 id="rush">FSILG Rush</h2>
  		<p>Once a term or so, we have a <b>rush</b> period, where we have all sorts of fun events. From hair dying to juggling, playing with trash compactors to telephone pictionary (if you haven't played, you haven't lived!) there's always something fun going on. (Of course, you're welcome to come meet us any time, not just during rush!)</p>
  		<p>Visit our rush website at <a href="http://rush.pikans.org">rush.pikans.org</a>.<p>

  		<hr class="featurette-divider">

  		<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>
  		<p>During the summer, we open up the house to the wider community, which means you can live at pika without having a bid from pika. We like to think of it as a time for people to find out if pika might be right for them.</p>
  		<p>During the summer, we can house non-MIT students!</p>
  		<p>We'll send out emails to our social lists and dorm mailing lists when we're ready to accept applicants for summer. If you're not on those lists, email pika-rush at mit.edu to get a "rush survey" (our quirky version of an application).</p>
